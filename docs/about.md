## Project Philosophy

All public projects follow these principles:

### 1. Production-Ready

Every template and module is designed for real-world production use, not just demonstrations.
This includes:

- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging and observability
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization

### 2. Developer Experience

Projects prioritize developer productivity with:

- Clear documentation
- Automated tooling
- Pre-configured development environments
- Git hooks for quality assurance

### 3. Modern Tooling

All projects use the latest stable tooling:

- **Package Managers**: pnpm, pip, go modules
- **Linters/Formatters**: Biome (replacing ESLint/Prettier), Ruff
- **Git Hooks**: Lefthook (replacing pre-commit in some projects)
- **Testing**: Vitest (replacing Jest for TypeScript)

### 4. Security First

Security is built-in, not bolted on:

- Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Least-privilege IAM policies
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Open Source Contributions
